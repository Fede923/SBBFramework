    - Start with what has been done previously with ML and poker, then look at GP and diversity and finish up with SBB and second layer. All this material will find its way into your thesis, and some will be useful for paper writing.

head start?
Deterministic Crowding?


- why all diversities start at around the same value? (same seed) Why there is absolutelly no diversity when no diversity metric is used? (check if it keeps like this even for multiple runs)
